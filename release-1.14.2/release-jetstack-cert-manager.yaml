        Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to your system have been applied.

        The steps to apply the upgraded images are different depending on the installation plan approval policy you used when installing the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift.
        - If the approval policy is set to `Automatic`, then the Operator will be upgraded automatically when there is a new version of the Operator. No further action is required to upgrade. This is the default setting.
        - If you changed the approval policy to `Manual`, then you must manually approve the upgrade to the Operator.

        See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/security/cert_manager_operator/index.html for additional information.
